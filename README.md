# Architecture Overview

A modern data warehouse embraces a **modular, layer-based architecture** that cleanly separates data ingestion, transformation, storage, and consumption. This separation of concerns is not merely for organization—it directly impacts the **scalability, availability**, and **performance** of the entire system. 

True scalability isn’t just about handling more data; it’s about doing so efficiently, selectively, and without over-provisioning. High availability depends on the ability to **monitor**, **degrade gracefully**, and **recover** quickly. Performance, in turn, often comes down to resource orchestration more than raw code optimization.

Below are key design principles that reinforce these goals:
- **Separation of Concerns Enables Elastic Scaling**  
    Layers must be able to **scale independently** based on workload patterns. For example, transformation layers may need to scale out temporarily during peak ingestion windows, while reporting layers remain idle. Likewise, **components can be spun down** when not needed, reducing cost and improving system availability by minimizing unnecessary surface area.
- **Scalability Is Bidirectional**  
    The architecture must support both **scale-up** (adding resources for heavier processing) and **scale-down** (releasing compute for cost-efficiency). This flexibility is critical for systems that handle highly variable workloads—like hourly batch loads and interactive dashboards running in parallel.
- **Performance Is a Resource Management Problem**  
    Rather than relying solely on code optimization, since sometimes software engineer is more expensive than commodity computer, modern systems often improve performance by **allocating more compute or memory**—especially for I/O-heavy tasks like joins or aggregations. The ability to dynamically adjust resources is a performance enabler.
- **Shared Tools Across Layers**  
    While responsibilities are layered, the tools used need not be isolated. For instance, DuckDB or Spark may appear in both the **staging** and **reporting** layers depending on usage. Separation is about _purpose_, not always _technology_.
- **Observability Drives Availability**  
    Every data flow, ingestion checkpoint, and processing component must be **observable**. By tracking tool health and pipeline checkpoints with systems like **Prometheus** or **OpenTelemetry**, the platform ensures fast issue detection, reproducibility, and recoverability—critical components of high availability.
- **Store What Fails, Not Just What Works**  
    A robust warehouse retains **raw, failed, and partial data** alongside transformed outputs. This ensures **auditabiity**, supports **backfill** scenarios, and provides a **fallback** when transformations break or upstream data quality shifts. It also enhances incident response, making the system more resilient and available.
- **Composable Systems, Not Monoliths**  
    Modularity means you can install or use only the components relevant to a specific data context. For example, ephemeral compute for transformations doesn’t need long-running servers. This reduces operational burden and aligns with cloud-native principles of _ephemeral compute + persistent storage_.

## Dataflow Design

Data start mainly as 2 types batch and stream:
- **Batch processing** involves collecting data over a period of time and processing it in large or moderate-sized chunks. This approach is not event-driven—instead, it relies on scheduled jobs or triggers that run at fixed intervals (e.g., hourly, daily). Data is first stored, then processed in bulk. For example, a daily sales report generated at midnight or log files analyzed every few hours are classic batch scenarios. Batch processing typically comes with **higher latency**, ranging from seconds to hours or even days, depending on the frequency of execution.
- **Stream processing**, on the other hand, is inherently **event-driven**. Data is ingested and processed in real time, immediately as events occur. This model is designed to handle continuous flows of small data points with **very low latency**, often within milliseconds or seconds. It’s ideal for use cases where time-sensitive insights are critical, such as monitoring IoT sensors, processing financial transactions, or detecting anomalies in real time.

Batch processing can arrive in structured, semi-structured, or unstructured manner. But stream data usually comes in unstructured manner. In summary, while **batch processing** is time-driven and suited for scenarios where immediate response is not required, **stream processing** thrives in **event-driven environments** where instant reaction to incoming data is essential.
